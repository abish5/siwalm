            <h1>Careers</h1>
            <br>
            <h4>Internship and Young Professionals</h4>
            <p>
                We offer a custom-made service, arranging individual, long-term placements across Somali regions. 
                We match the skills of students and professionals to the needs of national, regional and local government, 
                private and NGOs organizations that work towards sustainable development. Placements may cover the area of 
                water resources management, irrigation development, watershed development, environmental monitoring, water 
                supply and sanitation development and agricultural development projects.
            </p>
            <h4>Employment Opportunities</h4>
            <p>
                SIWALM is at the forefront of Somalia's sustainable development dialogue in championing the course of resource 
                poor farmers and marginalized communities. Our focus is on providing Somalia with knowledge-based development 
                services and building national, regional and global coalitions for development change.
                We work with a new generation of expert professionals who want to contribute to sustainable development by 
                offering strategic approaches to long-standing problems of natural resources development and management in Somalia. 
                We seek individuals who can advice new ideas across cultures and all strata of our society. We often advertise for 
                new openings whenever they fall due on our web pages and through our networks in Somalia and Canada.
