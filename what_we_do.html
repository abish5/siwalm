            <h2>Training and Capacity Building</h2>
            <p>
                SIWALM carries out training and capacity building programs that improve capacities of university students, 
                professionals, sub-professionals, community and smallholder farmers in water and land resources management with 
                a focus on water management for food production and climate change adaptation and mitigation. These training 
                include specialized technical and non-technical workshops as well as short-term and long-term courses. The 
                workshops and courses are basically demand driven to tackle identified problems in the water and agriculture sectors of Somalia.
                <br><br>
                The short-term courses are three to five days modular training organized for targeted groups in agricultural 
                water management, these kinds of courses include: water policy, agricultural water use, drainage, flood management, 
                advanced irrigated agriculture, project management , research methods, and other topics.
                <br><br>
                The long-term courses are more specialized professional training for high level manpower in integrated water management. 
                They include: Post Graduate Diploma (12 months) in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Small-Scale Irrigation 
                Planning and Management, and Master of Science (24 months) in Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) and Irrigation Engineering.
