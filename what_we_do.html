            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <br>
            <p><b>Background – Challenges and Opportunities</b></p>
            <p>
                Somali water and land resources have enormous challenges. On the one hand, water availability (rainfall/runoff) 
                is a major constraint. There are two rainfall seasons: Gu, which passes through the North from mid-March to June, 
                and Deyr, which passes through the South from mid-September to November. The mean annual rainfall distribution in 
                the county varies from less than 100 mm in the North to 600 mm in the South and 75% of this annual rainfall is 
                recorded during the Gu season. Moreover, the Juba and Shabelle rivers are the only perennial rivers in the 
                country, but 90% of their flow originates from Ethiopia, and some from Kenya. Groundwater resources are 
                limited because of the limited recharge due to the hot and arid climate and highly variable rainfall. 
                On the other hand, land degradation in the form of deforestation for charcoal, soil erosion and especially 
                loss of nutrients, overgrazing and exhaustion of soils, desertification, and sand encroachment are reducing 
                the arable land of the country.   
            </p>
            <p> 
                Climate change is further exacerbating these challenges through the increased severity and frequency of 
                droughts and floods. They affect all aspects of life in rural and urban population. Droughts occur 
                severely every 7–9 years. In 2018, 220,000 people were displaced because of the floods, which 
                impacted crops, shelters, infrastructure and increased the risk of the Acute Watery Diarrhea. 
                Furthermore, population growth, urbanization, and lack of water governance, water infrastructure/services, 
                finance, facilities, capacity/skills, data will make sustainable development and management of the natural 
                resources of the country a daunting task.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Somalia has reasonable potential water and land resources to be developed for food security and sustainable 
                rural and urban development. However, the country needs to build its technical, institutional, and 
                organisational capacities to effectively manage its land and water resources; therefore, SIWALM Institute 
                was set up to impart training and conduct action and adaptive research on water and land management with 
                a view to enhancing sustainable agricultural systems and natural ecosystem. The overarching objectives 
                of the institute are to: 
            </p>
            <ul class="donate-list">
                <li>Provide sustainable and objective-oriented training that can sustainably retain trained manpower.</li>
                <li>Promote practice of integrated water and land management to address water, food and energy security.</li>
                <li>Enhance Sustainable Development in Somalia through Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. </li>
                <li>Promote environmental conservation and protection as integral parts of water and land development. </li>
                <li>Promote water-harvesting techniques using local resources and indigenous skills and transferring 
                    rainwater-harvesting techniques that have been successful elsewhere for agricultural and water supply purposes.</li>
                <li>Build and strengthen small-scale irrigation development capacity of local Higher Education Institutes. </li>
                <li>Build and strengthen sustainable urban drainage systems planning and design capacity of local municipalities. </li>
            </ul>
