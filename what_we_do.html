            <h1>Background</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Water scarcity, serious land degradation and rapid population growth are major development challenges facing 
                in Somalia. On the one hand, water availability (rainfall/runoff) is a major constraint. Much of the country 
                has arid or semi-arid climate due to extreme low and variable rainfall, which is often unreliable. The mean 
                annual rainfall distribution in the county varies from less than 100 mm in the North to 600 mm in the South 
                and 75% of this annual rainfall is recorded during the Gu season from July to September. Moreover, the Juba 
                and Shabelle rivers are the only perennial rivers in the country, but 90% of their flow originates from 
                Ethiopia, and some from Kenya. Groundwater resources are limited because of the limited recharge due to 
                the hot and arid climate. On the other hand, land degradation by natural causes such as droughts, soil 
                erosion, sand encroachment and by human activities such as over-cultivation, overgrazing, and deforestation 
                for charcoal are reducing the arable land of the country. The country has also high population rate of 2.9% 
                that is exerting enormous pressure on the natural resource base and ecological systems. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Climate change is further exacerbating these challenges through the increased severity and frequency of droughts 
                and floods. They affect all aspects of life in rural and urban population. Droughts occur severely every 7–9 years. 
                In 2018, 220,000 people were displaced because of the floods, which impacted crops, shelters, infrastructure and 
                increased the risk of the Acute Watery Diarrhea.  Furthermore, population growth, urbanization, and lack of water 
                governance, water infrastructure/services, finance, facilities, capacity/skills, data will make sustainable 
                management of the natural resources of the country a daunting task.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the above compelling challenges, the necessity of establishing an institution at country level was felt and 
                SIWALM Institute was established in 2018 to impart training and conduct participatory action research and 
                development for sustainable agriculture development and natural resource management.
