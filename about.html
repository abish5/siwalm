            <h1>OUR WORK</h1>
            <p>
                SIWALM is a non-profit training, research and sustainable development institute with headquarter 
                in Ottawa, Canada and operations centre in Mogadishu, Somalia. The institute is committed to help 
                Somalia sustainably develop its water and land resources for food, nutrition, livelihood and environmental security.
                <br><br>
                The institute was founded by Somali-Canadian research team in 2018 with the conviction that capacity 
                building and technology transfer are essential for sustainable development of natural resources. 
                We also believe that it might take longer the country to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
                target without scaling up local capacity development at individual, leadership, institutional and 
                societal level through education, training and knowledge dissemination. 
                <br><br>
                SIWALM aims are to build, enhance and 
                strengthen local human capacities for irrigation development, integrated watershed management and climate change 
                adaptation, and to facilitate the transfer and dissemination of modern irrigation technology and innovations to 
                local universities, research centers, NGOs, public and private sector organizations, extension services and farmers 
                through collaboration, partnership and networking.
